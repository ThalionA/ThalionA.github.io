<h2>Logistics for Trekking in Nepal</h2>

<p><strong>Flights to/from Lukla:</strong> The flights to/from Lukla can be delayed or cancelled. Allow a few extra days at the beginning and end of your trip in Nepal to make sure you don't miss your international flights. We had two nights booked in Kathmandu after the trek in case the flight from Lukla was cancelled. Note that the flights leave from Ramechap airport during peak season and you will need to spend several hours in a jeep drive to get there from Kathmandu.</p>

<p><strong>Accommodation in Kathmandu:</strong> Book the same hotel in Kathmandu before and after your trek so that you can leave a bag with some extra clothing or items you won't need on the trek.</p>

<p><strong>Drinking Water Safety:</strong> Even in Kathmandu, do not drink water from the sink (and that includes when brushing your teeth!).</p>

<p><strong>Health Precautions:</strong> Keep a safe distance from other people on the trek and the teahouses to avoid catching a cold, flu, or another virus that would make your trek so much harder or force you to turn back.</p>

<p><strong>Solo Trekking Regulations:</strong> Double check the regulations for solo trekking. The national rules are that guides are mandatory for all trekkers but this rule was contested by the Khumbu municipality at the time of our trek and solo trekkers were still allowed.</p>

<p><strong>Hiring a Guide or Porter:</strong> If you hire a guide or porter (or a porter guide), tip generously and make sure your backpack isn't too heavy. Carry a day pack for the essential belongings during the day.</p>

<p><strong>Vaccinations:</strong> Allow several months before your trip to get your vaccinations up to date. Some will be covered by the NHS and others you'll have to pay for.</p>

<p><strong>Nepal Visa:</strong> You're likely to need a visa when entering Nepal. This can be obtained at the airport on arrival. Double check.</p>

<p><strong>Trekking Permits:</strong> You'll need two permits for the trek.</p>

<p><strong>Bringing Snacks:</strong> Bring some snacks from home on the trek. We brought some protein chocolate bars and loved them. You can find all kinds of nuts in Kathmandu to make your own trail mix if needed.</p>

<p><strong>Backpack Weight:</strong> Careful with the weight of your backpack! Theo's backpack was 15kg with water included. Lily's was about 12kg with water.</p>
