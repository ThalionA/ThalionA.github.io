# Monjo EBC Trek Day 1 - 24/10/23

This was the first day of the trek that will take us from Lukla to Everest Base Camp. It was quite full and as I sit here with a cup of tea in the communal area of the teahouse we'll be staying for the night, I'm already ready to sleep at 16:30! But since we're waiting for food anyway, I might as well jot some of the events of the day down.

The day began at 04:40, with barely 4h of sleep. Our driver picked us up from the hotel and we drove for 4h to Ramechhap, the road alternating from OK to really bad dirt tracks, and the driving style from impetuous to downright dangerous sometimes. It turned out that our driver had had just 1h of sleep on the previous night and it sounds like he works almost 24/7 to make ends meet because salary is so low and living costs so high. He can't afford his own car so he works for a company. Apparently close to his village he has seen everything from foxes and deer to leopards.

After he dropped us off at the airport (a tiny building with an airstrip that takes up 2 football fields at most, and manual "check" for dangerous items that seems to be mostly taken at your word), we had probably one of the most spectacular flights to be had anywhere. We flew over mountainous terrain mostly forested and we could see to the north massive snow-capped peaks (unfortunately we weren't really able to tell which one was which.) protected by rugged fortifications in between. How did the first people, without access to phones and helicopters, manage to find a way to Everest and the other 8000ers? What drove them to such extraordinary lengths? How did they even dare to imagine such things possible? We follow now in their footsteps, but we walk only part of the path. And yet, we still judge others who walk smaller parts of this same path (helicopters seem to be flying overhead every 5 min or less; who are all these people? Where are they being flown to and from? Do they just touch EBC and fly back down? Are they injured or sick? Will we get injured or sick higher up?), or walk the same path but in a different way (e.g., I saw a woman, even younger than us potentially, who was drinking from a water pouch that her guide/porter was carrying. She was carrying absolutely nothing herself. I mean, nonjudgment has its limits).

In any case, after a good breakfast in Lukla, and obtaining permits etc., we hiked for about 5 hours give or take, passing multiple hanging bridges which for me were actually quite scary! (Not for Lily though! She seemed to be at ease with the heights, enjoying the mountain views far more than the wobbly bridges below her feet.)

We also passed (or rather let pass) many yaks and mules with their loads. And many local people with their loads, which for the most part they hang around their forehead and back. They pass us uphill or downhill as if it's nothing for them. The children look happy and they're playing outside which is nice to see. The scenery is a valley with mountains on each side and milky-blue glacial water roaring down.

We made it to Monjo after approximately 13km, 5h of hiking (7:30h in total since arriving in Lukla), ~530m of ascent and ~560m descent, and a final elevation of ~2840m for the day.

We've had our momos and dal bhat now and we're drinking copious amounts of tea before bed.

# Namche Bazaar EBC Trek Day 2 - 28/10/23

A very different atmosphere this evening compared to yesterday. While yesterday we were alone in the teahouse's common room for the most part, today the room is full of people of all sorts (locals, Serbians, French, American, Kiwis, potentially South African) - it's much warmer as well, with the use of an AC, instead of yesterday's smokey and inefficient stove.

Today we only walked 6km and ~3h before reaching Namche, which is situated at ~3440m. The hike was still strenuous owing to the steep incline most of the way. We passed 2 more hanging bridges, bringing the total to 4. I have to say, today the crossing felt easier and I could even look around. We talked a little bit with a Sherpa whom I asked how much weight he was carrying. 30kg was the answer! And he kept pace with us for most of the way. He said that I looked strong to be carrying such a big backpack (although it was just half of his haha!) It was quite warm under the sun so I had raised the sleeves of my t-shirt to my shoulders, and then a local guy exclaimed "oh, I like your body!" at which point I was very embarrassed and had to lower them immediately. I felt like he was making fun of me for "showing off" but Lily didn't think so.

The town of Namche itself is almost cosmopolitan. You can choose among 55(!) different lodges (we chose Yak Hotel), you can withdraw money from ATMs, and pay by card, you can get burgers and pizzas (we had one), and different places play movies at midday (usually mountain documentaries). There are also many mountaineering gear shops.

We'll stay two nights here to acclimatize to the altitude, with a day hike to Everest View Hotel tomorrow. We'll also take our first shower tomorrow. Ah, the things to look forward to!

# Namche Bazaar EBC Trek Day 3 - 29/10/23

A much quieter evening today with the common room much emptier than yesterday. There's even space close to the heater to dry the towels we used for our (very hot) showers earlier (500 rs apiece).

Today we did our little acclimatization hike to Everest View Hotel. Quite steep to begin with and then levelled out. Many helicopters overhead again, many landing at the hotel's helipads. It's weird to see that; I definitely don't feel positive about these kind of tourists here. What is the point? Maybe ticking an item off the bucket list by saying you've seen Everest? On the other hand, again, where do we draw the line between taking a flight from Europe (or US / China / N. Zealand) and then another flight from Kathmandu to Lukla before starting the trek? We're also contributing a ton of greenhouse gases and pollution in general, to do what exactly? Satisfy our sense of curiosity and get a sense of awe at best? Test our strength and resilience? Prove something to ourselves or to those around us? Get attention? I guess you have to be privileged enough to even ask these questions.

On the way to the hotel, we stopped at Sagarmatha Next, an organization that helps locals (through their own SPCC) reverse the effects of the pollution that westerners like us are responsible for to a large extent.

Hopefully, we can also help a little bit by carrying some rubbish bags down with us from Namche to Lukla on our return. These will then get flown down to Kathmandu for recycling. Does that make up for our impact here, I'm not sure. It's very conflicting; how can we enjoy these sorts of places and fulfill our dreams (wherever they come from), while at the same time avoiding having an impact on the environment and/or the local cultures? Is it possible to achieve both or is it always a bad tradeoff to be made (like everything else in life)? Maybe if someone achieves a level of influence (like Alex Honnold e.g.), then you can both have a positive impact and continue doing the things you love. At Sagarmatha Next, we also got to experience different parts of the Everest climb; the basecamp, crossing crevasses on the Khumbu Icefall, Camp IV on South Col, and the Balcony seeing all the oxygen bottles lying around in the snow and some climbers heading up for the summit. I couldn't help but think "it doesn't look too steep." There's a couple of American-sounding guys sitting in the other corner of the room and it sounds like they might be going for a peak (not sure whether Everest itself or one of the smaller ones around). The host is currently talking to them about Ama Dablam, helicopters, freezing water pipes in the winter (it sounds like his ancestors migrated here from Tibet 4 generations ago and they've been living in Namche since then. It's interesting to listen to them, but I can't help but notice that he and his family and staff have been much more friendly to them compared to us. Apparently, since COVID, trekker numbers are down by ~60%. I'm not sure how to feel about that, whether to be relieved that there are fewer people and therefore less impact on the environment, or sad for the local economy and those who depend on tourism.

We saw Ama Dablam for the first time today, looking very sharp and impressive. We also saw Lhotse and Everest for a little while, even though when we reached the hotel the latter was hidden behind clouds. We didn't actually stay there because everything was very expensive. I got to run down a little bit on the trail back!
