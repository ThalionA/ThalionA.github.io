The main book I used to create a structured training plan was Training for the New Alpinism by Steve House and Scott Johnston:

The main training principles from this book are:
<ul>
  <li>Continuity - consistent training trumps "epic" workouts</li>
  <li>Gradualness - progressive overload</li>
  <li>Modulation - adaptations happen while you rest</li>
</ul>

Taking into account that I live in a very flat area, my training revolved around 3 main axes for this trek:
<ul>
  <li>Aerobic base: Two running sessions per week; one long (typically > 8km) and slow (nose-breathing throughout), one short (typically 5km) and fast (typically < 5min/km pace for me) </li>
  <li>Weight training: Typically two sessions per week with a split between the 3 main lifts (squats, deadlifts, bench press)</li>
  <li>Some form of weighted uphill training (with a backpack) - typically using a box step, an incline treadmill, or (when lucky) hiking</li>
</ul>


This document shows my training schedule for the 4 months leading up to the trek:
