The main book I used to create a structured training plan was Training for the New Alpinism by Steve House and Scott Johnston <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18342422-training-for-the-new-alpinism" target="_blank">goodreads link</a>, <a href="https://amzn.eu/d/iwcMpq0" target="_blank">amazon link</a>
If you'd like to test your fitness, here's a free online app I created to do so using either a running or a rowing test: <a href="https://vo2max.streamlit.app/" target="_blank">VO2 max test</a>
