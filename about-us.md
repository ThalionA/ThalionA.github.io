title: About us
---

We are a couple from Greece (Theo) and France (Lily). We work in academia (Theo, postdoc in neuroscience) and counselling (Lily, trauma and sex & relationship therapy). We currently live in Cambridge, having moved from Edinburgh at the end of 2022. We are very much into climbing and mountaineering, and love to spend time outdoors in general.
